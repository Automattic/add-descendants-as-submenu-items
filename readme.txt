Automatically all of a nav menu item's descendants as submenu items. Designed for pages but will work with any hierarchical post type.

== Description ==

When adding a page (or any hierarchical custom post type) to your navigation menu (Appearance -> Menus), this plugin allows you to check a checkbox that when checked will automatically add all descendants (children) of that post type as submenu items.

In short, you'll no longer have to manually maintain submenus when you add a new child page to your site.

== Installation ==
